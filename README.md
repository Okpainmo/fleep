# Fleep Finance - A Layer-2 Decentralized Application Targeting Africa.
## _A Xend Finance X Polygon Hackathon Project_

Despite the numerous advantages of blockchain and how it can drastically improve the financial system of today, we are still yet to unleash these benefits because the adoption is still quite low especially in Africa, government laws and restrictions etc.

We believe Fleep finance will bring more adoption to web3(in general) in Africa by educating, incentivizing, and localizing decentralized finance.

Today DEFI protocols out there are built targeting on a global scale leaving a wide gap between DEFI and developing countries in Africa, the best way to 
bridge the gap is a unique tailored product that brings DEFI closer to these countries.

- # Testnet Mode
    It can be so easy to lost or unwilling stake funds in DEFI protocols if the user is new or still learning how the system works which is also one of major reasons why most Africans are scared to get into DEFI.
    
    With testnet mode, our users will able to interact with all the fleep features with fake assets and fees from faucets, and switch to mainnet when they are confident enough.
