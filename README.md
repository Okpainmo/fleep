Despite the numerous advantages of blockchain and how it can drastically improve the financial system of today, we are still yet to unleash these benefits because the adoption is still quite low especially in Africa, government laws and restrictions etc.

We believe Fleep finance will bring more adoption to web3(in general) in Africa by educating, incentivizing, and localizing decentralized finance.

Today DEFI protocols out there are built targeting on a global scale leaving a wide gap between DEFI and developing countries in Africa, the best way to 
bridge the gap is a unique tailored protocol that brings DEFI closer to such countries.

## Features
- # Swap and Dust sweeping 
    Exchange assets to others assets with a low gas fee.
  - Dust sweeping means swapping all assets below $20 to a particular asset in a single transaction.

- # Liquidity and AutoYield Earning
    Providing liquidity and autoyield are ways of investing your crypto in fleep finance.
    
  - Provide Liquidity and earn 0.2% fee on all trades proportional to your share of the pool.
  - Stake USDT, USDC, AAVE, WBTC in the xAuto Yield protocol to earn up to 15% APY. Built on Xend finance.
    
- # Testnet Mode
    It can be so easy to lost or unwilling stake funds in DEFI protocols if the user is new or still learning how the system works which is also one of major reasons why most Africans are scared to get into DEFI.
    
    With testnet mode, our users will able to interact with all the fleep features with fake assets and fees from faucets, and switch to mainnet when they are confident enough.
  
- # Buy/Sell Crypto with Local Currencies
